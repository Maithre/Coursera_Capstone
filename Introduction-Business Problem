Introduction:
A small restaurant owner wants to improve his/her sales in the locality. 
With more and more food joints opening in the same locality, he/she wants to find out more about the demographics of 
the customers visiting.
Using the Foursquare customer data, the owner could run targetted campaings and deals, 
which in turn would improve the restaurants ratings and also create a loyal customer base.
