For the Restaurant owner to improve his sales by leveraging Four Square API, we need the following data,

-> Number of Check-ins 
-> Number of Customers
-> Gender and Age Group of Customers
-> The Reviews posted
-> WHere the Check-ins are shared
-> Time and Frequencies of the Check-ins

To make sure we get more data, the restaurant should encourage customers to ‘check in here’ using FourSquare.
